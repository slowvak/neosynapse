**Thread Starter (280 chars):**

Three years ago, your hospital spent $2M on an AI sepsis predictor.

Last month, someone asked why nobody uses it.

You weren't surprised.

Here's why most medical AI never makes it from the lab to the bedside—and what successful deployment actually looks like 🧵

**Follow-up Tweets:**
```
1/ The validation study showed 89% sensitivity. The demo was impressive. The vendor promised "revolutionary early detection."

But now it sits dormant in your EHR—just another ignored alert, another unused dashboard.

Why? Because publication ≠ implementation.
```

```
2/ Most AI tools fail NOT because of bad algorithms, but because of deployment failures:

• Workflow mismatch (extra clicks kill adoption)
• Poor EHR integration (separate portals = DOA)
• Alert fatigue (you already ignore 90% of alerts)
• Latency (45 sec = too slow)
```

```
3/ The AI that works? It's embedded in your *existing* workflow—not bolted on.

Example: @FlowSigma uses BPMN to map AI directly into clinical processes. You don't "use the AI." You use your normal workflow, which includes AI.

That's deployment done right.
```

```
4/ Before adopting any AI tool, ask:

1. Where does this fit in my workflow?
2. How long does it take to get results?
3. What happens when it's wrong?
4. Who else uses it successfully?
5. Can I see the training data?
6. How do I override it?
```

```
5/ The real test of medical AI isn't the validation study.

It's whether you'll still be using it six months from now.

Your hospital bought an expensive AI tool.

The accuracy was 95%.
The validation study was flawless.
Nobody uses it.

Sound familiar?

Here's why most medical AI fails at deployment (and what to demand before adoption):

Controversial take:

We don't have an AI accuracy problem in medicine.

We have an AI deployment problem.

A model with 95% AUC that nobody uses is worth less than a simple checklist that everyone follows.

**Standalone Tweet (Data-driven):**
```
PubMed is flooded with AI validation studies.

Yet physicians still don't use most AI tools.

The gap between "works in research" and "works in practice" is enormous.

### LinkedIn Post (Professional)

**Version 1: Problem-focused**
```
Three years ago, your hospital invested $2M in an AI sepsis prediction system.

Last month, you got an email asking why adoption rates are near zero.

You weren't surprised.

This story repeats across healthcare institutions worldwide. Impressive validation studies. Promising demos. And then... silence.

The uncomfortable truth? Most medical AI never makes it from lab to bedside—not because the algorithms are bad, but because deployment is *hard*.

Here's where it typically breaks down:

🔴 Workflow Mismatch
AI that requires extra clicks, separate logins, or manual data entry gets abandoned within weeks.

🔴 Poor EHR Integration
Tools that live outside the EHR might as well not exist. Context-switching kills adoption.

🔴 Alert Fatigue
Physicians already ignore 90% of EHR alerts. Adding more "smart" alerts doesn't help—it makes the problem worse.

🔴 Lack of Accountability
When the AI is wrong, the physician is responsible. If you can't explain *why* it recommended something, you'll default to your own judgment.

The AI tools that DO succeed? They share these traits:

✅ Embedded in existing workflows (not bolted on)
✅ Trigger clear escalation pathways (not just alerts)
✅ Designed *with* clinicians (not just for them)
✅ Support physician accountability through transparency

I wrote about this challenge—and what successful deployment actually looks like—including examples from platforms like FlowSigma that get integration right.

If you're involved in medical AI development, procurement, or implementation, this is essential reading.

The validation study was flawless.
The deployment was a disaster.

If this sounds familiar, you've experienced the #1 challenge in medical AI: the gap between impressive lab results and actual clinical adoption.

After analyzing dozens of failed AI deployments, a clear pattern emerges:

❌ Most failures aren't about algorithm accuracy
✅ They're about workflow integration, trust, and usability

Here's what separates AI tools that physicians actually use from those that gather dust:

1️⃣ **Embedded, Not Bolted-On**
Successful AI lives *inside* the clinical workflow. Example: Auto-populating differential diagnoses in the note you're already writing—not a separate dashboard you have to check.

2️⃣ **Actionable Escalation**
Instead of just flagging problems, successful AI triggers workflows that solve them. An abnormal EKG doesn't just alert—it pages cardiology automatically.

3️⃣ **Clinician-Designed**
Tools built *with* physicians (not just *for* them) account for real-world constraints: time pressure, cognitive load, liability concerns.

Platforms like FlowSigma demonstrate this approach—using BPMN workflow automation to embed AI into existing clinical processes rather than forcing clinicians to adapt their workflow to the AI.

I've written a detailed analysis of why deployment fails and what successful implementation requires.

Key questions to ask before adopting any AI tool:
• Where does this fit in my workflow?
• What happens when it's wrong?
• Who else uses it successfully?
• How do I override it?

Because the real test of medical AI isn't the validation study—it's whether you'll still be using it six months from now.

### Reddit Post (r/medicine or r/radiology)

**Title:**
```
[Discussion] Why your hospital's $2M AI tool sits unused: The unsexy reality of medical AI deployment
```

**Body:**
```
Throwaway because I work in healthcare IT, but I wanted to share something that doesn't get talked about enough.

We've all seen this pattern:

1. Hospital buys expensive AI tool
2. Validation study shows 90%+ accuracy
3. Vendor demos are impressive
4. Six months later: nobody uses it

I used to think this was because physicians were "resistant to change" or "didn't trust AI."

Turns out, it's because deployment is *hard*, and most AI vendors have never actually worked in a clinical environment.

## Where it breaks down:

**Workflow mismatch**
- AI requires logging into separate portal → never gets used
- Results take 45+ seconds → too slow for real-time decisions
- Requires manual data entry → physicians won't do it

**Alert fatigue**
- EHR already has 20+ interruptive alerts
- Adding "smart" alerts just trains you to ignore more alerts
- High sensitivity = low specificity = noise

**Poor EHR integration**
- Lives outside Epic/Cerner = might as well not exist
- Can't pull patient data automatically
- Can't push results back to chart seamlessly

**Trust & accountability**
- When AI is wrong, *you're* still responsible
- No explanation for predictions = can't use it to make decisions
- Can't document "AI said so" when patient decompensates

## What actually works:

I've seen a handful of successful deployments. They all share these traits:

1. **Embedded in workflow** - AI sits inside the EHR screen you're already using, not a separate app
2. **Triggers action** - Doesn't just alert, creates tasks/pages appropriate teams
3. **Fast** - Results in <5 seconds or it's useless
4. **Designed with clinicians** - Not built in a vacuum by engineers who've never worked a shift

Example: FlowSigma (clinical workflow platform) embeds AI into BPMN processes. Radiologist doesn't "use AI"—they just do their normal QC workflow, which happens to include automated checks that route flagged cases to the right team.

## Questions to ask before your hospital buys AI:

- Where does this fit in my workflow? (If answer is "separate portal," run.)
- How long for results? (>10 sec = won't be used)
- What happens when it's wrong? (Vendor should have clear answer)
- Who else uses it successfully? (Ask for references, talk to them)
- Can I override it easily? (If not, you'll just ignore it instead)

The problem isn't that AI doesn't work. It's that **deployment is treated as an afterthought**.

Validation studies optimize for accuracy. Clinical deployment must optimize for usability, integration, trust, and workflow fit—none of which show up in a confusion matrix.

**Caption:**
```
Why does your hospital's AI sit unused? 💭

Three years ago: $2M investment in AI sepsis predictor
Last month: Email asking why nobody uses it

The problem? 👇

❌ Not the algorithm
✅ The deployment

Most medical AI fails because:
• Requires extra clicks (friction kills adoption)
• Lives outside the EHR (context-switching = no)
• Adds to alert fatigue (already ignoring 90%)
• Takes too long (45 sec too slow for clinical decisions)

The AI that works?
→ Embedded in your existing workflow
→ Triggers clear actions (not just alerts)
→ Designed WITH clinicians, not FOR them

Because the real test isn't the validation study—it's whether you're still using it 6 months later.
