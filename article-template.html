                    <p class="lead">
                        The emergency department is midnight-quiet when the algorithm flags it: 87% probability of sepsis. You look at the patient—vitals stable, talking, asking when they can go home. The machine says "treat now." Your instinct says "wait and watch."
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This is the new dilemma. Not whether AI will replace doctors—it won't. But whether we'll know when to trust it, when to question it, and when to override it entirely.
                    </p>

                    <h2>The Illusion of Certainty</h2>

                    <p>
                        Medical algorithms promise precision. Feed them data—labs, vitals, imaging—and out comes a probability. 87% sepsis risk. 92% chance of readmission. 78% likelihood of response to treatment.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        But here's what the percentage doesn't tell you:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>How the patient <em>feels</em> about their illness</li>
                        <li>What they're <em>not</em> telling you because they're embarrassed</li>
                        <li>The context that turns "stable" into "about to crash"</li>
                    </ul>

                    <blockquote class="article-quote">
                        "The algorithm can predict. But only the clinician can understand."
                    </blockquote>

                    <h2>What AI Can't Learn (Yet)</h2>

                    <p>
                        Machine learning excels at pattern recognition. Show it 100,000 chest X-rays, and it'll spot pneumonia faster than most radiologists. But show it a patient who's terrified of hospitals because their mother died in one—and suddenly the algorithm has nothing to say.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The future doctor must master what the machine cannot:
                    </p>

                    <h3>1. Clinical Intuition</h3>
                    <p>
                        That nagging feeling when something's "off" despite normal labs. Pattern recognition beyond what's in the dataset. The ability to see what the numbers miss.
                    </p>

                    <h3>2. Ethical Judgment</h3>
                    <p>
                        When the algorithm recommends aggressive treatment for a terminal patient who wants comfort care. When cost-effectiveness clashes with compassion. When population-level optimization fails the individual.
                    </p>

                    <h3>3. Human Connection</h3>
                    <p>
                        The conversation that changes a diagnosis. The trust that makes a patient reveal the real reason they came in. The presence that makes suffering bearable.
                    </p>

                    <div class="article-callout">
                        <h4>Key Insight</h4>
                        <p>
                            AI won't replace doctors. But doctors who use AI effectively <em>will</em> replace those who don't. The question isn't whether to adopt these tools—it's whether you'll learn to wield them wisely.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <h2>The New Clinical Skillset</h2>

                    <p>
                        So what does the AI-augmented clinician need to master?
                    </p>

                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Probabilistic thinking</strong> — Understanding what 87% actually means</li>
                        <li><strong>Algorithmic literacy</strong> — Knowing what the model learned from (and what it didn't)</li>
                        <li><strong>Diagnostic humility</strong> — Balancing confidence with uncertainty</li>
                        <li><strong>Selective trust</strong> — When to follow the algorithm, when to question it</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>
                        Medical school teaches diagnosis and treatment. But who's teaching <em>when to doubt the machine</em>?
                    </p>

                    <h2>The Patient Still Decides</h2>

                    <p>
                        Here's what often gets lost in the AI hype: medicine isn't just about optimal decisions. It's about <em>patient-centered</em> decisions.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        An algorithm might recommend chemotherapy based on survival statistics. But the patient might choose hospice because they value time with family over months in the ICU.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The future clinician doesn't just interpret AI outputs—they <em>translate</em> them. Turn probabilities into conversations. Transform recommendations into shared decisions.
                    </p>

                    <blockquote class="article-quote">
                        "Technology expands what's possible. But the human decides what's meaningful."
                    </blockquote>

                    <h2>Your Next Move</h2>

                    <p>
                        If you're training to be a doctor right now, here's what to focus on:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Learn the tech</strong> — Don't fear it, understand it</li>
                        <li><strong>Master the fundamentals</strong> — AI amplifies clinical knowledge, it doesn't replace it</li>
                        <li><strong>Practice the art</strong> — Empathy, communication, and presence can't be automated</li>
                        <li><strong>Question everything</strong> — Including (especially) the algorithm</li>
                    </ul>

                    <hr class="article-divider-line">

                    <p class="article-conclusion">
                        The algorithm won't replace you. But it will test you. Challenge you. Force you to think deeper about what makes medicine <em>human</em>.
                    </p>

                    <p class="article-conclusion">
                        And that, ultimately, makes you a better doctor.
                    </p>
